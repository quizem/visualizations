# Startup Venture Funding

In this project try to understand the investment patterns in startup companies. Our goal is to study the monthly report from Crunch Base to discover what kind of startups get the most attention.In the end, we present the insights in the form of simple plots that can be easily understood by the one asking questions of the data.

As part of the investigations, we may ask questions such as:

* Q1: How many unique companies were funded during the period under consideration?
* Q2: What are the top 10 markets by the number of companies that were funded?
* Q3: What were the markets that received the highest average funding in usd?
* Q3: what were the top five conutries with the highest averge funding?
